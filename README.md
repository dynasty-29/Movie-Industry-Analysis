Movie Industry Analysis

### Introduction

As of 2018, 54 percent of U.S.-based respondents stated that their favorite movie watching location was at home. Only around 13 percent of respondents stated that they preferred to watch movies in a theater, while 22 percent stated that they like the theater and home options equally.
Movies have long been a staple of the entertainment industry in both the United States and across the globe both for streaming services and movie theaters. According to statista, Netflix generated total revenue of nearly 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, up from about 6.64 billion in the corresponding quarter of 2020. Meaning that more and more people are turning to streaming services.
## Problem Statement

Nowadays, the most popular way to watch your favorite movie is to sign up on netflix and other online streaming services and watch from the cozy comfort of your couch. Unlike in the olden days whereby you had to go to the movie theater or actually buy the dvd, cd, blue ray of the movie you like. We are trying to find out with the addition and improvement of streaming services, is the movie industry on the decline or is it stronger than ever. The analysis herein will show the state of the movie industry for the years (1986 - 2016)

###### Data Source

This data named Movie Industry and was acquired from kaggle and can be acquired here Link

It has 10 columns and 6820 rows in the dataset.
#### Conclusions

During our analysis we determined that the movie industry was stronger than ever with a rising trajectory since 1980, with the peak year as 2016 which had the highest revenue ever. Although with the addition of streaming services it would seem that there would be decline in revenue but with this analysis we can conclude that the movie industry was not affected based on our dataset.

The Actors that had the highest number of eyeballs looking ahead for their films are Robert Downey Junior, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise since they grossed the highest in the Box Office.

### Recommendations

We recommend streaming services invest heavily on Action and Comedy Films since they had a high gross revenue to profit ratio.

Streaming services should partner with these production companies i.e. Warner Bros, Universal Studios, Columbia Pictures and 20th Century Fox

We recommend working with Steven Spielberg and Aaron Sorkin since he grossed a high revenue to profit ratio through their Action and Comedy films respectively
